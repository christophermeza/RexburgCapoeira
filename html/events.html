            <p>
                As with many martial arts, capoeira does hold its own events as well.
                On occasion, its members gather just to have fun and to socialize.
                Mostly, when Rexburg Capoeira hosts an event, is sister group which is
                located in Orem, UT meets up with it where a short workshop is held and a
                Brazilian dish is enjoyed afterwards.
                On other occasions, it meets with many other groups in Orem to have much
                bigger events such as a Batizado where the ranking ceremony occurs. Here
                you can see the events which are soon to occur.
